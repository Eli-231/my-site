                Volleyball is a sport played with a ball. Two teams, each made up of six players, face each other on a playing area separated by a central net. The objective of the game is to pass the ball over the net, making it reach the ground of the opposing team's court, while the opposing team simultaneously tries to prevent it from doing so, forcing it to miss in its attempt. An attack phase arises for one team when it attempts to get the ball to touch the ground of the opposing team's court, while a defense phase arises for the other team trying to prevent it.

                There are various forms of this sport. Although the name "volleyball" refers to the sport played on an indoor court, beach volleyball, played on sand, is also very popular (and Olympic-level). Sitting volleyball is a growing popular sport among disabled sports, and cachibol is widespread in senior communities. The Ecuadorian community around the world practices the local form, ecuav√≥ley. More informally, there are other forms that are popular in the summer, on beaches and tourist areas, such as footvolley, water volleyball, and bossaball.
